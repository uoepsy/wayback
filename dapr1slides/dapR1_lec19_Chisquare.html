# Purpose
- `\(\chi^2\)` goodness of fit test
  - The primary purpose is to test whether the collected data (observed frequencies) are consistent with a hypothesized/known distribution (expected frequencies).

- `\(\chi^2\)` test of independence:
  - We have 2 categorical variables, drawn from a single population.
  - We want to know if the variables are independent or not.
  - If the category membership is dependent, then knowing what category someone is in on variable 1, helps us predict what category they would be in for variable 2.


---
# Data Requirements
- `\(\chi^2\)` goodness of fit test
  - Single categorical variable
  
- `\(\chi^2\)` test of independence:
  - Two categorical variables.
 
---
# Example: Goodness of fit
- Suppose we are interested in the distribution of students across three final year psychology options (Social, Differential, Developmental). 

- We have data from 2014-15, and we want to know if the distribution is the same in 2015-16.

## # A tibble: 6 x 2
##   ID    course

## 1 ID1   Differential 
## 2 ID2   Social       
## 3 ID3   Social       
## 4 ID4   Social       
## 5 ID5   Social       
## 6 ID6   Developmental
```

- `ID` = Unique ID variable
- `course` = factor with 3 levels (Social, Differential, Developmental)

# Observed frequencies


```r
tab1 &lt;- class %&gt;%
  group_by(course) %&gt;%
  tally()
```


```r
tab1
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 2
##   course            n
##   &lt;fct&gt;         &lt;int&gt;
## 1 Differential     28
## 2 Social           62
## 3 Developmental    60
```


---
# Relative frequencies
- In 2014-15, the department had the following proportions:
  - Social = 0.50, or 50%
  - Differential = 0.30, or 30%
  - Developmental = 0.20, or 20%


---
# Relative frequencies


```r
tab1 &lt;- tab1 %&gt;%
  transmute(
    course = course,
    relative = c(0.30, 0.50, 0.20),
    observed = n
  )
```


```r
tab1
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 3
##   course        relative observed
##   &lt;fct&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;
## 1 Differential       0.3       28
## 2 Social             0.5       62
## 3 Developmental      0.2       60
```


---
# Expected frequencies
- Given this, and a total number of students (n=150) for the current year, we can calculate the expected frequencies for each area.
  - `\(Expected = Relative*N\)`


---
# Put it together


```r
tab1 &lt;- tab1 %&gt;%
  mutate(
    expected = relative*sum(observed)
  )
```


```r

# Welcome Back!

**Now we have discussed how to calculate the core values from our data, let's think about our hypotheses, test statistic, and inferential testing.** 

---
# Hypotheses
$$
`\begin{matrix}
H_0 = P(0.20, 0.50, 0.30) \\
H_1 \neq P(0.20, 0.50, 0.30)
\end{matrix}`
$$

- `\(H_0\)` says that the data follow a specific and known pattern or probabilities (frequencies)
- `\(H_1\)` says they don't


---
# Test statistic

$$
\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{(E_i - O_i)^2}{E_i}
$$

- `\(E_i\)` = expected frequencies
- `\(O_i\)` = observed frequencies
- `\(\sum_{i=1}^{k}\)` = do the calculation starting from cell 1 through to cell `\(k\)` (k=number groups) and add them up.

---
# Null Distribution
- Sampling distribution for `\(\chi^2\)` test is a `\(\chi^2\)` distribution.

- `\(\chi^2\)` distribution describes the distribution of the sum of `\(k\)` squared independent standard normal variables.
  - Huh?
  
$$
\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{(E_i - O_i)^2}{E_i}
$$


---
# Null Distribution
- Parameter of the `\(\chi^2\)` distribution is degrees of freedom (df) 
  - Just like `\(t\)`-test.
  
- df are determined by the number of categories ( `\(k\)` )

- Goodness of fit test has `\(k-1\)` degrees of freedom.
  - Why?

---
# Null Distribution

.pull-right[

- The plot shows `\(\chi^2\)` distributions for 2 (black), 3 (red), and 5 (blue) df's

- Note that as the df increase, the area under the curve for smaller values increases.

- What does that mean?
  - It means as we add up more things, we would expect the random fluctuations from 0 to to also increase.
  - In any given sample, even if the null is true in the population, sampling variability would mean we have some non-zero values.
  - So we need to account for this.

]

# Calculation


```r
tab1 &lt;- tab1 %&gt;%
  mutate(
    step1 = expected - observed,
    step2 = step1^2,
    step3 = step2/expected
  )
tab1
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 7
##   course        relative observed expected step1 step2 step3
##   &lt;fct&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 Differential       0.3       28       45    17   289  6.42
## 2 Social             0.5       62       75    13   169  2.25
## 3 Developmental      0.2       60       30   -30   900 30
```

- Step1 = `\(E_i - O_i\)`
- Step2 = `\((E_i - O_i)^2\)`
- Step3 = `\(\frac{(E_i - O_i)^2}{E_i}\)`

---
# Calculation
- Last step is to sum the values for step 3 to get the `\(\chi^2\)`


```r
x2 &lt;- sum(tab1$step3)
x2
```

# Is my test significant?
- `\(\chi^2\)` = 38.68

- Degrees of freedom = 3-1 = 2

- `\(\alpha\)` = 0.05

# Write up

A `\(\chi^2\)` goodness of fit test was conducted in order to investigate whether the distribution of students across Social, Developmental and Differential classes was equivalent in 2014- 15 and 2015-16. The goodness of fit test was significant ( `\(\chi^2\)`(2) = 38.68, `\(p\)`&lt;.05) and thus the null hypothesis was rejected. The distribution of student's across courses differs between the two academic years.

# Welcome Back!

**We will now follow the same steps for a test of independence.**

---
# Example: Independence
- I have conducted an experiment with three conditions (n=120, 40 per group)

- I want to check whether my participants are equally distributed based on some demographic variables.
  - Let's focus on whether English is participants first language

- Recall from an experimental design perspective, I want such things to be randomized across my groups.
  - So I would expect an even distribution.

# Data

## 3 ID3   control   No   
## 4 ID4   control   Yes  
## 5 ID5   control   No   
## 6 ID6   control   No
```

- `ID` = Unique ID variable
- `condition` = experimental conditions (control, group1, group2)
- `lang` = binary Yes/No for English as first language

---
# Tabular format

# Test statistic
- The test statistic looks much the same as the statistic for the GoF test.

`$$\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{r}\sum_{i=1}^{c} \frac{(\hat{E_{ij}} - O_{ij})^2}{\hat{E_{ij}}}$$`

- What is different?
  - `\(\sum_{i=1}^{r}\sum_{i=1}^{c}\)` simply means sum the quantities for all cells in all rows (r) and columns (c)
  - But why `\(\hat{E_{ij}}\)`? Why the hat?

---
# Expected frequencies
- Remember in the GoF test we knew the expected frequencies because we had known proportions and known sample size.
  - Here we do not have that.
  
- So we have to estimate the expected frequencies from the data. 
  - Hence we use `\(\hat{E}\)` to show this is an estimate.
  
`$$\hat{E_{ij}} = \frac{R_iC_j}{N}$$`

- Where
  - `\(R_i\)` = the row marginal for a cell `\(i\)`
  - `\(C_i\)` = the column marginal for a cell `\(j\)`
  - `\(N\)` = total sample size

- Here we will show the calculation for one cell (for the cell by cell calculations see the additional material).

---
# Calculation: Controls-No


```
##          
##            No Yes Sum
##   control  19  21  40
##   group1   31   9  40
##   group2   15  25  40
##   Sum      65  55 120
```

`$$\hat{E_{11}} = \frac{R_1C_1}{N} = \frac{40*65}{120} = \frac{2600}{120} = 21.67 \\$$`

`$$\frac{(\hat{E_{11}} - O_{11})^2}{\hat{E_{11}}} = \frac{(21.67 - 19)^2}{21.67} = \frac{7.1289}{21.67} = 0.33$$`

---
# Null Distribution
- Again, we evaluate the `\(\chi^2\)` test of independence statistic against the `\(\chi^2\)`-distribution.

- Here:

$$
df = (r-1)(c-1)
$$

- Note, `\(r\)` and `\(c\)` are just the number of levels for each categorical variable.

- In our example `\((r-1)(c-1)=(3-1)(2-1)=2*1=2\)`
  - Thus using the same `\(\alpha\)`=0.05, we would have the same critical value = 5.99

# Write up
A `\(\chi^2\)` test of independence was performed to examine whether the distribution of English first language speakers was consistent across experimental conditions (n=120). The relation between these variables was significant ($\chi^2$(2) = 13.96, p &lt;.05). Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis.

##   group2  -1.4322297  1.5569979
```


---
# Assumptions
- Sufficiently large N to approximate a normal sampling distribution
  - We saw last semester this actually begins to happen pretty fast.

- Expected and observed cell frequencies are sufficiently large.
  - If either drop below 5, then there is not really enough data.

- Each observation appears in only 1 cell.
  - Data are independent.
  - If data are dependent, we can use a McNemar test.

---
# Yate's correction
- Our `\(\chi^2\)` test only approximates a `\(\chi^2\)` sampling distribution.

- When we have a 2x2 table with df=1, it turns out this approximation is not very good.
  - So for 2x2 tables we apply Yate’s continuity correction.
  - This subtracts 0.5 from each cell deviation.
  - It is the default in R when we have a 2x2 table.

---
# Effect size
- Three possibilities:
  - Phi coefficient (for 2x2 tables)
  - Odds ratios
  - Cramer's V
  
- We will discuss odds ratios more in year 2, so let's look at Phi and Cramer's V.

---
# Effect size
- The equations for both measures are shown below:

`$$Phi = \sqrt{\frac{\chi^2}{N}}$$`


`$$CramerV = \sqrt{\frac{\chi^2}{N*min(r-1,c-1)}}$$`

- Cramer's V generalizes Phi to larger contingency tables.

---
# Cramer's V
- There is no base R calculation for Cramer's V.

- It is included in the `lsr` package for the Navarro book.

- Else we can construct it ourselves.

---
# Cramer's V


```r
CV = sqrt(ind_res$statistic /
    (length(exp$ID) * 
       (min(length(unique(exp$condition)),
            length(unique(exp$lang))

# Full calculations
- Last step is to add them up:

`$$\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{r}\sum_{i=1}^{c} \frac{(\hat{E_{ij}} - O_{ij})^2}{\hat{E_{ij}}}$$`


```r
x2i &lt;- 0.33 + 4.02 + 2.05 + 0.39 + 4.75 + 2.43
x2i
```

```
## [1] 13.97
```


---
# Full calculations
- And check against the R results (tiny bit of rounding error)


```r
ind_res
```

```
## 
## 	Pearson's Chi-squared test
## 
## data:  con
## X-squared = 13.964, df = 2, p-value = 0.0009286
```

---
# Full calculations
- And the p-value


```r
1 - pchisq(13.964, 2)
```

```
## [1] 0.0009284445
```


---
# Full calculations
- The Pearson's residuals are calculated as:

`$$Residual_{ij} = \frac{(E_{ij} - O_{ij})}{\sqrt{E_{ij}}}$$`


---
# Full calculations
- So let's do one residual and then look at the output of our analysis:

`$$Residual_{11} = \frac{(E_{11} - O_{11})}{\sqrt{E_{11}}} = \frac{(21.67 - 19)}{\sqrt{21.67}} = \frac{2.67}{4.655105} = 0.57$$`


```r
ind_res$residuals
```

```
##          
##                   No        Yes
##   control -0.5728919  0.6227992
##   group1   2.0051216 -2.1797970
##   group2  -1.4322297  1.5569979
```

# Full calculations
- Hold on....why is our calculation positive, and the R results negative?

- This is just an interpretation point.
  - In our calculation, we have used `\(E_{ij} - O_{ij}\)`
  - If instead we calculate `\(O_{ij} - E_{ij}\)`, then we would get the same absolute value but negative.
  - Why not try it.
