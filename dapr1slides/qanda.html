# YOUR SETTINGS

**PLEASE MAKE SURE YOUR MICORPHONES ARE ON MUTE AND YOUR CAMERAS OFF**

---
# AUDIO CHECK

**Can you all hear me talking?**

Please type yes or no into the text chat.

**And can you hear Jo?**

**And Umberto?**

# ASKING QUESTIONS
+ Please type all questions into the text chat.

+ Please wait to ask questions until asked to do so. 
  + This makes it easier for us to keep track.
  + I will stop and give lots of chances.

+ When I do, please type them into the chat.
  + Keep an eye in case the question has been asked already.

# RECORDING

**I AM NOW TURNING THE RECORDING ON**

---
# CONCERNS
+ As we move through, things highlighted in blue are summary topics/questions from the Padlet and survey.

+ **Programming and stats**
  + A little history on course
  + Slow and steady
  + Data analysis vs stats

---
# ONLINE LEARNING
+ **MISSING MATERIAL**
  + We will do a LEARN tour later.
  + Everything will be in one file for the week.
  + If anything happens centrally to impact access (e.g. yesterday!) we will take account of that.
  
---
# ONLINE LEARNING
+ **How will on-line teaching work?**
+ **It's all on-line so less structured**
+ **Not having access to resources due to being online**
  + This may be the most structured we have ever been!
  
+ Lectures
  + Recorded, with exercises.

+ Labs
  + Self-directed learning with supported drop-ins
  + Lecturer office hours
  

---
# DROP-IN'S AND PEER SUPPORT
+ **Not being able to ask questions as we work though**
  + We hope we have made enough spaces that you will be able to.
  
+ 4 drop-in's per week.

+ In principle, you can attend them all
  + But, we need to have a bit of a trust/honour system.
  + If you have attended already in the week, and the session gets very full, allow others to ask questions

+ Open course room
  + Come and study any time.
  + If it is always full, we may have capacity issues, but I dont think this will happen.
  + Arrange with others to study togther here.
  + Discussion forum thread to find study partners at times that work for you all.

---
# FINDING HELP
+ Drop-in's

+ Office hours

+ Discussion boards

# ASSESSMENT
+ **When do we have tests, how often?**
  + Every week.
  + Quizzes or lab tests will appear at the top of each "Weekly Materials" folder.
  
+ Quizzes
  + Quizzes will be the first 4 weeks of each 5 week teaching block. 
  + Weeks 1 and 2 are practice and do not count towards your assessment.
  + There are 16 assessed quizzes. 
  + Always released on a Monday at 9am, close Sunday at 5pm GMT.
  + You have 1 hr to complete each test. 
  +~10 MCQ questions each time (sometimes fewer)
  + Best 12/16 scores are averaged to be your quiz mark.
  + Worth 20% overall grade.

---
# ASSESSMENT
+ Lab tests
  + Every 5th week
  + Week 5 semester 1 = practice and does not count
  + Remaining 3 are 10% each (30% total).
  + We will give you a skeleton Rmd file, you fill in the code chunks.

---
# ASSESSMENT
+ **What happens if we miss a test?**
  + You can miss 4, or performing worse than you would have liked, and it has no impact (14/18)
  + If you miss more, and have reasons of suitable magnitude you can submit special circumstances
  + Otherwise it lowers your grade.
  
---
# ASSESSMENT
+ **When are the report deadlines?**
  + On LEARN dashboard there is a button for assessment. 
  + We will put all information on reports here.
  + We will add the deadlines this week
  + And let you know as and when we add details of the assessments.

+ Report (50%) semester 2
