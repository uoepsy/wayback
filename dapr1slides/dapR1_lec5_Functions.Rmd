# Weeks Learning Objectives
1. Understand the basic principles of functions.

2. Understand concept of data transformations.

3. Understand the calculation of z-scores.

---
# Topics for today
+ What is a function?

--

+ Linear and non-linear functions

--

+ How do we use functions in statistics?

--

+ An example of z-scores
  
---
# What is a function?
+ A function takes an **input**, **does something**, and provides an **output.**

--

+ **Input**

$$
x = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 
2 \\ 
3 \\ 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

--

+ **Doing something**

$$
f(x) = x-2
$$

--

+ **An output **

$$
y = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 \\ 
0 \\ 
1 \\ 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

???
+ Functions can become as complex as we want them to be.
+ Why $y$?


---
# Functions and relations
+ It is important to think of the function as showing the *relationship* between input and output.

+ We can link this to the idea of relationships from week 4.

+ The function links an input (predictors, $x$), to an output (outcome, $y$)

--

+ So we can write

$$y = f(x) = x-2$$


---
# Visualising Functions
+ An important tool in understanding functions is to plot them.

+ So let's look at the following:


$$
y = f(x) = 10 + 2x
$$

???
+ This helps us both understand plots
+ And gain intuition about functions.
  
---
# Visualising Functions
+ Our input $x$ is a vector of numbers:

$$
x = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 
2 \\ 
3 \\
4 \\
5 \\ 
6 \\ 
7 \\
8 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$


???
+ As well as the functions getting more complex, so can the inputs.
+ We are sticking with small examples to help visualize what is happening and get an intuition
    + But this could be 10,000 elements long
    + could contain values like 1.7875453
    + Computers can deal with all this for us quite easily!

# Visualising Simple Functions

```{r, echo=FALSE}
func_x <- tibble(
  x = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8), 
  y = 10 + (2*x) 
)
  
kable(func_x) %>%
  kable_styling(., full_width = F)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
func_x <- tibble(
  x = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8), 
  y = 10 + (2*x) #<<
)
```

+ `tibble` is used to create a data set

+ `x` is our original data entered as a vector of numbers using `c()`

+ `y` is the output of the function `f(x) = 10+(2*x)`

# Multiple arguments
+ Functions can take multiple arguments. Consider:

$$
y = f(x,z) = 10 + (x*z)
$$

+ Where:

$$
x = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 
2 \\ 
3 \\ 
\end{bmatrix}
$$



$$
z = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 
2 \\ 
3 \\ 
\end{bmatrix}
$$



---

# Multiple arguments

.pull-left[
```{r,echo=FALSE}
func_xz <- tibble(
  x = c(1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3),
  z = c(1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3)
)

kable(func_xz) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)
```
]

.pull-right[

+ Notice that when we have multiple inputs, our rows correspond to pairs of inputs.

+ So $x$ = 1, pairs with:
  + $z$ = 1
  + $z$ = 2
  + $z$ = 3
  
+ and so on for all values of $x$

# Multiple arguments

.pull-left[
```{r,echo=FALSE}
func_xz2 <- tibble(
  x = c(1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3),
  z = c(1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3),
  "f(x,z)" = 10 + (x*z)

  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)

.pull-right[

$$
y = f(x,z) = 10 + (x*z)
$$

+ Example 1, row 2

$$
10 + (1*2) = 12
$$

+ Example, row 8

$$
10 + (3*2) = 16
$$

# Linear vs non-linear functions
+ Each of the examples so far have been linear functions.
    + If we plot them, we get a straight line (or flat surface)
    
+ Can also have non-linear functions:
    + A non-linear function would contain powers or roots

# Non-linear functions

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
fun2 <- function(x) 5+(x^2)
func_x2 <- tibble(
  x = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8), 
  y = 5 + (x^2) 
)
ggplot(func_x2, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point(colour = "red", size = 2) +
  stat_function(fun = fun2) +
  xlim(0, 10) +
  ylab("y") +
  ylim(0, 125)
```

**Example of non-linear function**

$$
y = f(x) = 15 + x^2

# Why are functions important?
+ There are going to be lots of examples of functions in action.

--

+ Two primary examples are:
    + **Data transformations**
    + **Describing formal models**

--

+ We will start with transformations, and come back to models at the end of the course.


---
# z-scores
+ One of the most common transformations in data analysis is standardizing variables.

+ What is standardizing?

--

  + It is putting all variables onto the same scale so they can be compared.

--

+ We refer to standardized variables as $z$-scores (the reason we will explain later)

--

+ $z$-score:

$$z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$$

---
# Z-score for measured variable
+ $z$-score for $x$:

$$z_{x_i} = \frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{s_x}$$

+ Where
  + $x_i$ = individual score on $x$
  + $\bar{x}$ = mean of $x$
  + $s_x$ = standard deviation of $x$


---
# z-scores
+ A $z$-score will have a mean = 0, and a SD = 1.

--

+ What this means is there is a standard way to interpret $z$-scores.

--

  + $z$-score = 1.5, means a respondent is 1.5 SD above the mean.

--

  + $z$-score = -2, means a respondent is 2 SD below the mean.


---
# Summary of today
+ Functions take input, do something, and produce an output.

+ Functions can have multiple arguments, be linear or non-linear

+ Typically we will visualize functions

+ We use functions frequently in statistics. 

+ In fact almost everything we are going to see involves functions.

---
# Next tasks
+ Next week, there will be no new material.
  + Use next week to review and catch up on weeks 1-5.
  + In week 7 we will begin looking at probability.

+ This week:
  + Complete your lab
  + Come to office hours
  + Complete your practice lab test (R content from weeks 1 to 4)
      + Open Monday 09:00
      + Closes Sunday 17:00
