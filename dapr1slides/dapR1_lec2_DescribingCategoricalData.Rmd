# Topics for today
+ Last week we looked at definitions of different types of data.

+ Now we are going to move on to how we describe different types of data.

+ First, we will look at categorical variables.

---
class: center, middle

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width= "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/DataAnalysis.png")
```

???
+Make point that the next 3 weeks are looking at the middle section, whilst practicing the first two
+ To visualize, we need to introduce the concept of the frequency distribution

---
# Recap: Categorical data

+ Nominal
  + No order to the levels of the variable
  + E.g. "Country of residence", "Degree Studied"
      + 1 = Psychology
      + 2 = Philosophy
      + 3 = English Language
  + We can give each response a numerical value, but convey no meaning beyond group membership
  
--

+ Ordinal
  + Numerical values denote order.
  + E.g. "Level of Education"
      + 1 = GCSE
      + 2 = A-level
      + 3 = University undergraduate degree
      + 4 = University postgraduate degree

---
# Frequency Distribution

> **"a mathematical function showing the number of instances in which a variable takes each of its possible values."**

+ Or put simply

> **A plot showing the number of instances of each value of a variable**

---
# An example

.pull-left[

+ I toss a coin 10 times 

+ I plot the number of instances of head and tails.

]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(1066)
df <- tibble(
    dat = factor(rbinom(10, 1, 0.5))
)
bp <- df %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x=dat)) +
    geom_bar(fill="steelblue4") +
    labs(x = "Coin toss result", y = "Count") +
    scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Heads", "Tails"))


bp
```
]


---
# Plotting fundamentals 

.pull-left[

+ There are many types of graph, all of which are intended to summarise different types of data, or the relations between data.

+ We are going to spend a lot of time dealing with plots this semester.

+ Let's pause for a moment and consider the basic structure
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
bp
```
]


---
# Plotting fundamentals 

.pull-left[

+ Data

+ Axes 
  + (aesthetics in `ggplot` language - also includes size, colours etc.)

+ Axes have scales

+ Geometric objects 
  + (`geoms` in `ggplot` language; i.e. bars, points, lines)
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
bp
```
]


---
# Bar plot

.pull-left[

+ Bar plots are used to show frequency distributions of categorical variables.

+ Our example:
  + **Data** = result of our 10 coin tosses.
  
  + **X-axis**: values of variable (here "Heads" or "Tails)
      + Scale = two discrete values
  
  + **Y-axis**: Frequency
      + Scale = count 
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
bp
```
]




---
# Bar plot

.pull-left[

```{r, eval=FALSE}
df %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x=dat)) +
    geom_bar(fill="steelblue4") +
    labs(x = "Coin toss result", y = "Count") +
    scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Heads", "Tails"))
```

+ `df` = data set
+ `aes(x=dat)` = the variable `dat` is used on x-axis
+ `geom_bar()` = make a bar plot
  + `fill="steelblue4"` = make the bars blue
+ `labs` = what to label each axis
+ `scale_x_discrete` = what to label to tick marks on the x-axis

]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
bp
```
]

# A more realistic example

.pull-left[
+ Suppose I am running a stats summer school.

+ It is open to all students in PPLS
  + All degrees
  + All years
  
+ I gather data on all 150 attendees.
  + `ID` = unique identifier
  + `Degree` = degree studied
  + `Year` = year of study
  + `Score1` = pre-summer school score
  + `Score2` = post-summer school score 
  
+ Let's describe `Degree` and `Year`
]


.pull-right[

**Data from 10 participants**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ex1 <- read_csv("./ex1.csv", col_types = "cfddd")
kable(ex1[1:10,])
```



]

# Bar plot for `Degree`

.pull-left[

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ex1 %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x=Degree)) +
    geom_bar(fill="steelblue4") +
    labs(x = "Degree Subject", y = "Count")
```


]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ex1 %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x=Degree)) +
    geom_bar(fill="steelblue4") +
    labs(x = "\n Degree Subject", y = "Count \n")
```
]


???
How do I describe this with numbers?


---
# Describing distributions
+ We typically want to know something about the:
  + central point, and
  + the spread (or dispersion around centre point)

--

+ **Central tendency**
  + a set of statistics that describe the central point of frequency distributions.
  + typically referred to as "averages"
      + But this can have many meanings.

--

+ **Dispersion**
  + a set of statistics that descibe the variation in frequency distributions


---
# Categorical Data

+ Nominal

--

  + Central tendency = Mode
  + Variability = Relative frequency

--

+ Ordinal

--

  + Central tendency = mode or median
  + Variability = Range, inter-quartile range
  
  
---
# Frequency Table: Degree

.pull-left[

+ A frequency table shows:
  + Possible outcomes
  + Count of the number of observations per outcome
  + We can also add the count as a percentage


+ The code:
  + `count` provides the frequency of each value
  + `mutate` is used to calculate new variables
  + `round(n/sum(n)*100,2)`
      + take the column created by `count`, `n`, 
      + divide each value by the sum of counts (=sample size)
      + *100 to turn to a percent

]

.pull-right[
```{r}
ex1 %>%
  count(Degree) %>%
  mutate(
    Percent = round((n/sum(n))*100,2)
  )
```

]


---
#  Mode: Degree 

.pull-left[
> **Mode**: The most commonly observed value in the data set.

+ It is of course possible that we observe two (or more) values with equal frequency.

+ We then have a **multi-modal** distribution.

]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ex1 %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x=Degree)) +
    geom_bar(fill="steelblue4") +
    labs(x = "\n Degree Subject", y = "Count \n")
```

]

]

.pull-right[
```{r}
ex1 %>%
  count(Degree)
```

]

# Bar plot for `Year`

.pull-left[
```{r, eval=FALSE}
ex1 %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x=Year)) +
    geom_bar(fill="steelblue4") +
    labs(x = "\n Degree Year", 
         y = "Count \n")
```

]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ex1 %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x=Year)) +
    geom_bar(fill="steelblue4") +
    labs(x = "\n Degree Year", y = "Count \n")
```

]


---
# Median: `Year`

> **Median:** is the value for which half the data falls above, and half below the given value.

+ To calculate the median:
  + Rank order the data.
  + Find the middle value.

+ The position of the median is given by:

$$median = \frac{n+1}{2}$$

+ For an odd number of data points, this will equal a whole number.

+ For an even number of data points, this will equal a mid-point between two values.
  + e.g. 5.5 would indicate the median is between the 5th and 6th position.
  + The median is then equal to the average of these numbers.

---
# Calculating median: Small example

.pull-left[

**Odd number of elements**
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
3 \\ 
1 \\ 
6 \\
10 \\
5 \\ 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

**Rank order**

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 
3 \\ 
5 \\
6 \\
10 \\ 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

]

.pull-right[

**Calculate position of median**

$$median = \frac{n+1}{2} = \frac{5+1}{2} = 3$$


**Apply to ordered data**

+ The third value in the ordered vector = 5

]


---
# Calculating median: Small example

.pull-left[

**Even number of elements**
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
3 \\ 
1 \\ 
6 \\
10 \\
5 \\
8 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

**Rank order**

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 
3 \\ 
5 \\
6 \\
8 \\
10 \\ 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

]

.pull-right[

**Calculate position of median**

$$median = \frac{n+1}{2} = \frac{6+1}{2} = 3.5$$


**Apply to ordered data**

+ The 3rd value = 5

+ The 4th value = 6


**Average**

$$\frac{5+6}{2} = 5.5$$
]

# Median: Year

.pull-left[

+ For small examples, hand calculation is fine.

+ But we have 150 data points!

+ Thank goodness for computers and `R`

]


.pull-right[

```{r}
median(ex1$Year)
```


]

---
# Range: Year

.pull-left[
+ The **range** of the data is simply the value between two points.
  + We can define these points in different ways.

+ Simplest is the total range in the data (maximum - minimum).
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
min(ex1$Year)
```

```{r}
max(ex1$Year)
```

```{r}
range(ex1$Year)
```

]


---
# Inter-quartile range: Year
+ The **inter-quartile range (IQR)** is the difference between the 1st and 3rd quartile.
  + Rank the data
  + Split data into four equal blocks.
  + Quartiles are the points which divide these blocks.
  + They fall at 25%, 50% and 75% of rank ordered data.
  + IQR is the difference between 25% and 75%

--

+ For ordinal data:
  + The first quartile is the first category for which the cumulative percentage is $\geq 25\%$.  
  + The median is the first category for which the cumulative percentage is $\geq 50\%$.  
  + The fourth quartile is the first category for which the cumulative percentage is $\geq 75\%$.


---
# What is cumulative percentage?

+ Remember our percentage calculations?

+ Well, imagine stacking these on top of one another...

```{r}
ex1 %>%
  count(Degree) %>%
  mutate(
    Percent = round((n/sum(n))*100,2),
    Cumulative = cumsum(Percent) #<<
  )
```

+ More on this in labs.


---
# Inter-quartile range: Year

.pull-left[
+ We can calculate the IQR directly using the function `IQR()`

+ Or calculate various quantiles using the `quantile()` function
]


.pull-right[

```{r}
quantile(ex1$Year, c(.25, .75))
```

+ So the 25th percentile = 2, and the 75th = 3

+ So the inter-quartile range is....

```{r}
IQR(ex1$Year)
```

]

---
# Ranks and order
+ Notice how both the median and the IQR make use of ranked data.

+ Ranked = ordered.

+ Hence use with ordinal data.

---
# Summary of today
+ Phew, time for a breather!

+ To describe nominal data we use
  + Bar plots
  + Mode
  + Frequency tables

+ To describe ordinal data we use:
  + Bar plots
  + Mode or median
  + Range (total, IQR)
