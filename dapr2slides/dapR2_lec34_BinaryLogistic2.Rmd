# Weeks Learning Objectives
1. Identify and provide examples of binary psychological outcomes.
2. Understand why a standard LM is not appropriate for binary data.
3. Fit and interpret a logistic model

# Topics for today
+ More logistic regression
	+ The effects of individual IVs
	+ Model selection
	+ Other issues

#  Our data and model
+ Imagine we're interested in predicting hiring decisions. 

+ We collect data on n=242 job-seekers
	+ Age
	+ Effort put into job application

+ Our variables:
	+ DV: `work` (0 = did not get job; 1 = did get job)
	+ IV1: `age` (in years)
	+ IV2: `msrch` (effort into job application, 0=low effort, 1 = high effort)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
m2 <- glm(work ~ age + msrch, data = hire, family = "binomial")
summary(m2)
```

---
#  Job-seeking example 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
m2 <- glm(work ~ age + msrch, data = hire, family = "binomial")
summary(m2)
```


---
#  Model equation: job-seeking example 
+ Below we have the general form with two $x$'s

$$P(y_i) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2)}}$$

+ And we can insert the values from the previous slide with our model results:


$$P(y_i) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(4.525 -0.118age + 1.683msrch)}}$$

---
#  Interpreting logistic model coefficients
+ In linear regression, the $b$ coefficients for each IV are the unit increase in $Y$ for every unit increase in $X$ (holding other IVs constant)

+ In logistic regression, the $b$ coefficients for each IV are the **change in log odds of $Y$ for every unit increase in $x$** (holding other IVs constant)


---
#  What are log odds? 
$b$ = **the change in log odds of $Y$ for every unit increase in $X$**

+ The odds of an event occurring (e.g., a job offer; Y=1) is defined as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of the event not occurring:

$$odds = \frac{P(Y=1)}{1-P(Y=1)}$$

+ $P(Y=1)$ is the same as $P(y_i)$ calculated in the logistic regression model
  + Think of a coin toss.
  + Odds of tails occurring = 0.5
  + Odds of not tails = 0.5
  + Odds = 1


---
#  What are log odds?  
$b$ = **the change in log odds of $Y$ for every unit increase in $X$**

+ Log odds are then the natural logarithm of the odds:


$$log odds = ln \left (\frac{P(Y=1)}{1-P(Y=1)} \right)$$

---
#  Probabilities, odds and log-odds 

```{r}
tibble(
  Probs = seq(0.1, 0.9, 0.1)
) %>%
  mutate(
    Odds = round(Probs/(1-Probs),2),
    Logits = round(log(Odds),2)
  )
```



---
#  For our job-seekers example 
+ For every additional year of age, there was a decrease in the log odds of a job offer of 0.118

+ Those who showed high effort in their application had a 1.683 greater log odds of a job offer than those who showed low effort

---
#  Odds ratio 
+ Log odds don't provide an easily interpretable way of understanding how the DV changes with the IV's

+ The $b$ coefficients from logistic regression are thus often converted to odds ratios
	+ Odds ratios are a bit easier to interpret
	+ Odds ratios are obtained by exponentiating the $b$ coefficients

+ In R, we exponentiate coefficients using the `exp()` function.

---
#  Exponentiating $b$ coefficients 

```{r}
exp(coef(m2))
```


---
#  Interpreting odds ratios  

+ When the coefficients are converted to odds ratios, they represent the **change in odds with a unit increase in X**
	+ Specifically the *ratio of odds* at X=x and X=x+1
	
+ An odds ratio of 1 indicates no effect

+ An odds ratio < 1 indicates a negative effect

+ An odds ratio of >1 indicates a positive effect

---
#  Interpreting odds ratios 

```{r}
exp(coef(m2))
```

+ For every year of `age`, the odds of being hired decrease by 0.88.

+ For those who put high effort into applications, the odds of being hired increase by a factor of 5.38.

**Now let's look at the significance of predictors**


---
#  Statistical significance of predictors
+ We can also evaluate the statistical significance of the predictors

+ To do this we can use a $z$-test:

$$z = \frac{b}{SE(b)}$$

+ However , we should be aware that the $z$-test is a little prone to Type II errors
	+ We can supplement it using model selection procedures (see later)

+ The z-test and associated $p$-value is provided as part of the summary output for `glm()`

---
#  The z-test 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(m2)
```


---
#  Confidence intervals  
+ We can also compute confidence intervals for our coefficients and associated odds ratios
	+ For odds ratios, a value of 1= no effect
	+ The question is, therefore, whether the confidence interval includes 1 or not

---
#  95% confidence intervals for our job-seekers example 

.pull-left[
+ We can use the `confint()` function to compute confidence intervals

+ We can embed this in the `exp()` function to convert our coefficients to odds ratios.

+ Neither 95% CI includes 1, therefore, both predictors are significant at $p$<.05.
]

.pull-right[

```{r}
exp(confint(m2))
```

---
#  Model selection 

+ Just as in linear regression, we can compare logistic models differing in their predictors to choose a best fitting model

+ Methods we can use:
	+ Likelihood ratio test
	+ AIC
	+ BIC


---
#  Likelihood ratio test 
+ We already encountered this when we compared our model to a baseline model with no predictors.

+ We can compare any set of **nested**  models using the likelihood ratio test
	+ Including models differing in one predictor
	+ This tests the statistical significance of the effect of that predictor
	+ Provides an alternative to the z-test

---
#  Likelihood ratio test in R 

```{r}
m_null <- glm(work ~ 1, data = hire, family = "binomial")
m_age <- glm(work ~ age , data = hire, family = "binomial")
m_full <- glm(work ~ age + msrch, data = hire, family = "binomial")

anova(m_null, m_age, m_full, test = "Chisq")
```


---
#  AIC and BIC  
+ We met AIC and BIC in the model selection section in linear regression
	+ Can be used to compare either nested or non-nested models
	+ Smaller (more negative) AIC and BIC indicate better fitting models
	+ BIC, in the context of regression, penalises extra predictors more heavily
	+ BIC differences >10 indicate that one model is better than another to a practically significant extent

---
#  AIC and BIC in R 

```{r}
AIC(m_null, m_age, m_full)
```


```{r}
BIC(m_null, m_age, m_full)
```


---
# Summary of today
+ Logistic regression coefficients are converted to  odds ratios to make them more interpretable
	+ Odds ratios tell us how the odds of the event change with a unit increase in X
		+ 1 is no effect
		+ Less than 1 is a negative effect
		+ More than 1 is a positive effect

+ Statistical significance of predictors can be assessed via:
	+ z-test
	+ Confidence intervals
	+ Likelihood ratio test

+ Model selection uses
	+ Likelihood ratio test
	+ AIC and BIC
