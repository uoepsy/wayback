# Weeks Learning Objectives
1. Understand the calculation and interpretation of the coefficient of determination. 

2. Understand the calculation and interpretation of the F-test of model utility.

3. Understand how to standardize model coefficients and when this is appropriate to do.

4. Understand the relationship between the correlation coefficient and the regression slope.

# Topics for today
+ Standardization of coefficients
  + Two ways to calculate standardized coefficients
  + Reasons to standardize
  + Standardized $\hat \beta_1^*$ and correlation coefficient ( $r$ )

---
# Unstandardized vs standardized coefficients
- So far we have calculated unstandardized $\hat \beta_1$.

+ We interpreted the slope as the change in $y$ units for a unit change in $x$
  + Where the unit is determined by how we have measured our variables.

+ In our running example:
  + A unit of study time is 1 hour.
  + A unit of test score is 1 point.
  
+ However, sometimes we may want to represent our results in standard units.

---
# Standardized units
+ Why might standard units be useful?

--

+ **If the scales of our variables are arbitrary.**
  + Example: A sum score of questionnaire items answered on a Likert scale.
  + A unit here would equal moving from a 2 to 3 on one item.
  + This is not especially meaningful (and actually has A LOT of associated assumptions)

--

+ **If we want to compare the effects of variables on different scales**
  + If we want to say something like, the effect of $x_1$ is stronger than the effect of $x_2$, we need a common scale.


---
# Standardizing the coefficients
+ After calculating a $\hat \beta_1$, it can be standardized by:


$$\hat{\beta_1^*} = \hat \beta_1 \frac{s_x}{s_y}$$

+ where;
  + $\hat{\beta_1^*}$ = standardized beta coefficient
  + $\hat \beta_1$ = unstandardized beta coefficient
  + $s_x$ = standard deviation of $x$
  + $s_y$ = standard deviation of $y$

---
# Standardizing the variables

+ Alternatively, for continuous variables, transforming both the IV and DV to $z$-scores (mean=0, SD=1) prior to fitting the model yields standardised betas.

+ $z$-score for $x$:

$$z_{x_i} = \frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{s_x}$$

+ and the $z$-score for $y$:

$$z_{y_i} = \frac{y_i - \bar{y}}{s_y}$$

+ That is, we divide the individual deviations from the mean by the standard deviation

# Two approaches in action


```{r}
res <- lm(score ~ hours, data = test)
summary(res)$coefficients
```

```{r}
1.055 * (sd(test$hours)/sd(test$score)) #<<
```

---
# Two approaches in action

```{r}
test <- test %>%
  mutate(
    z_score = scale(score, center = T, scale = T),
    z_hours = scale(hours, center = T, scale = T)
  )

res_z <- lm(z_score ~ z_hours, data = test) #<<
summary(res_z)$coefficients
```


---
#  Interpreting standardized regression coefficients  
+ $R^2$ , $F$ and $t$-test remain the same for the standardized coefficients as for unstandardised coefficients.

+ $b_0$ (intercept) = zero when all variables are standardized:
$$
\bar{y} - \hat \beta_1 \bar{x} = 0 - \hat \beta_1  0 = 0
$$

+ The interpretation of the coefficients becomes the increase in $y$ in standard deviation units for every standard deviation increase in $x$

+ So, in our example:

>**For every standard deviation increase in hours of study, test score increases by 0.72 standard deviations**

---
# Relationship to r
+ Standardized slope ( $\hat \beta_1^*$ ) = correlation coefficient ( $r$ ) for a linear model with a single continuous predictor.

+ In our example, $\hat \beta_{hours}^*$ = 0.72

```{r}
cor(test$hours, test$score)
```

+ $r$ is a standardized measure of linear association

+ $\hat \beta_1^*$ is a standardized measure of the linear slope.

---
# Which should we use? 
+ Unstandardized regression coefficients are often more useful when the variables are on  meaningful scales
	+ E.g. X additional hours of exercise per week adds Y years of healthy life

+ Sometimes it's useful to obtain standardized regression coefficients
	+ When the scales of variables are arbitrary
	+ When there is a desire to compare the effects of variables measured on different scales	

+ Cautions
	+ Just because you can put regression coefficients on a common metric doesn't mean they can be meaningfully compared.
	+ The SD is a poor measure of spread for skewed distributions, therefore, be cautious of their use with skewed variables
	
---
# Summary of today

+ We have looked at how to calculate standardized coefficients.
  + Either after a model has been run
  + Or do z-scoring the predictors.

+ When predictors have no meaningful scale, standardizing can help us interpret the effects.

+ But when the scale of the IVs are meaningful, it may be more useful to interpret unstandardized effects.
