# Weeks Learning Objectives
1. Understand the concept of an interaction.

2. Interpret interactions for between quantitative variables.

3. Interpret interactions between a quantitative and a binary variable.

4. Understand the principle of marginality and why this impacts modelling choices with interactions.

5. Visualize and probe interactions.

---
# Topics for today

+ Continuous-continuous (or quant-quant) interactions.

+ Probing and understanding interactions


---
#  General definition 

+ When the effects of one predictor on the outcome differ across levels of another predictor.

+ Continuous-continuous interaction (**referred to as moderation**):
	+ The slope of the regression line between a continuous predictor and the outcome changes as the values of a second continuous predictor change.
	
+ Note interactions are symmetrical. We can talk about interaction of X with Z, or Z with X.

---
#  Lecture notation 

`$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i} + \beta_2 z_{i} + \beta_3 xz_{i} + \epsilon_i$$`

+ Lecture notation:
  + `\(y\)` is a continuous outcome
  
  + `\(x\)` is a continuous predictor
  
  + `\(z\)` is a continuous predictor
  
  + `\(xz\)` is their product or interaction predictor

---
#  Interpretation: Continuous*Continuous 

`$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i} + \beta_2 z_{i} + \beta_3 xz_{i} + \epsilon_i$$`

+ Lecture notation:
  
  + `\(\beta_0\)` = Value of `\(y\)` when `\(x\)` and `\(z\)` are 0
  
  + `\(\beta_1\)` = Effect of `\(x\)` (slope) when `\(z\)` = 0
  
  + `\(\beta_2\)` = Effect of `\(z\)` (slope) when `\(x\)` = 0
  
  +  `\(\beta_3\)` = Change in slope of `\(x\)` on `\(y\)` across values of `\(z\)` (and vice versa).
	    + Or how the effect of `\(x\)` depends on `\(z\)` (and vice versa)

---
#  Interpretation: Continuous*Continuous 

`$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i} + \beta_2 z_{i} + \beta_3 xz_{i} + \epsilon_i$$`

+ Note, `\(\beta_1\)` and `\(\beta_2\)` and are referred to as conditional effects, **not as main effects** .
	
	+ They are the effects at the value 0 of the interacting variable.
	
	+ Main effects are typically assumed to be constant.
	
	+ For any `\(\beta\)` associated with a variable **not** included in the interaction, interpretation does not change.

---
#  Example: Continuous*Continuous 

+ Conducting a study on how years of service and employee performance ratings predicts salary in a sample of managers.

`$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i} + \beta_2 z_{i} + \beta_3 xz_{i} + \epsilon_i$$`

+ `\(y\)` = Salary (unit = thousands of pounds ).

+ `\(x\)` = Years of service.

+ `\(z\)` = Average performance ratings.

+ Pause the video. Take a few minutes to look at these results, vs the original model results 3 slides back. 

+ What do we notice here?

1. The values of the coefficients have changed for service and performance
2. The p-value significance has changed
3. the interaction has stayed the same
4. the model coefficients have stayed the same

+ The coefficients change because these are the slopes at specific values of the other variable 0.
+ Remember with an interaction, the relationship changes as the values of the other variable change, so we expect this.
+ The p-values change, because the slope has changed. The null = 0, no effect. So if the slope gets bigger or smaller, the p-value will also change

+ the values for `\(\beta_1\)` and `\(\beta_2\)` make a little more sense. We would expect service and performance increases to lead to increased pay.
+ However, there is an important point here. In the presence of a significant interaction, we tend not to interpret the conditional main effects.

+ This leads to the question of how do we interpret/understand the interaction. 

+ and we will come to that next.

# Time for a break

**Discussion board**

Interactions are tricky. 

Please take some time to reflect on this video, and post questions into the discussion board

---
class: center, middle
# Welcome Back!

**Where we left off... **

We had looked at the interpretation of the quant-quant interaction.

Now we will move on to consider how we visualize and probe the interaction to fully understand it.


---
#  Plotting interactions 

+ Simple slopes:
	+ **Regression of the outcome Y on a predictor X at specific values of an interacting variable Z.**
	
+ And we re-arranged such that:

`$$\hat{y} = (\beta_1 + \beta_3z)x + (\beta_2z + \beta_0)$$`

+ So all we need to do is select values of `\(Z\)`, or in our case, performance.
	+ This was easy when `\(Z\)` was binary (or categorical), we have a line for each group.
	+ Now we must select reasonable values.
	+ Norm is to take +/- 1SD and the mean value of `\(Z\)`.

---
#  Simple slope calculations 

+ In the current data, the SD for performance is 1.26

+ We want to plot values for performance ( `\(Z\)` ) of -1.26, 0 and 1.26:

`$$\hat{salary} = (1.425 + (3.255*-1.26))service + ((14.445*-1.26) + 104.848)$$`

`$$\hat{salary} = (1.425 + (3.255*0))service + ((14.445*0) + 104.848)$$`


`$$\hat{salary} = (1.425 + (3.255*1.26))service + ((14.445*1.26) + 104.848)$$`



---
#  Probing interactions 

+ We could plot these lines manually, but thankfully we have some useful 

+ The linear model provides an omnibus test of the interaction effect.

+ But there may be specific hypotheses/questions about our simple slopes.

+ As such, we may want a way to test the significance of the slopes for specific values of the interacting variable.

---
#  Probing interactions 

+ Note that our simple slopes analysis requires us to pick-a-point of `\(Z\)` at which we test the slope.
	+ Sometimes, we may not have a particular reason to choose any particular value.
	+ That has led to a default being to choose the mean of Z, and +1 and -1 standard deviation from the mean (i.e. low-average-high).
	+ If we do not know what values to choose, we may want a more general approach.
	
+ Cue regions of significance.
	+ Region of significance analysis identifies the thresholds (values of `\(Z\)`) at which the regression of `\(Y\)` on `\(X\)` changes from non-significance to significance.

+ Using the same object, we can look at regions of significance.

+ The function provides a plot -&gt;

+ And text interpretation:

&gt; When perfM is OUTSIDE the interval [-2.01, 0.53], the slope of servM is p &lt; .05. Note: The range of observed values of perfM is [-2.80, 3.20]

# Welcome Back!

**Where we left off... **

Finally, let's look at types of interaction


---
#  Types of interaction 

+ Ordinal:
	+ Lines do not cross within the plausible range of measurement of `\(x\)`.
	+ Rank order of one predictor is maintained across levels of another.
	+ More common in observational studies.

--

+ Disordinal :
	+ Line cross within the plausible range of measurement of `\(x\)`.
	+ Rank order of one predictor is not maintained across levels of another.
	+ More common in experimental work.

---
#  Locating a crossing point 

`$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i} + \beta_2 z_{i} + \beta_3 xz_{i} + \epsilon_i$$`

+ For `\(X\)` (service), the cross point is:

`$$\frac{-\beta_2}{\beta_3}$$`

+ For `\(Z\)` (performance), the cross point is:

`$$\frac{-\beta_1}{\beta_3}$$`

+ In both cases it is clear that the cross point is dependent on the relative magnitudes of the first-order effect to the high-order (interaction) effect.

---
#  Locating a crossing point 

.pull-left[
+ Calculations from `m2`.

+ For Performance:

`$$\frac{-1.425}{3.255} = -0.44$$`

+ For Service:

`$$\frac{-14.445}{3.255} = -4.44$$`

#  Higher order terms (Non-linear effects) 

+ The interaction equation:

`$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i} + \beta_2 z_{i} + \beta_3 xz_{i} + \epsilon_i$$`

+ We have noted for a continuous*continuous interaction this is a non-linear effect.

+ We have spoken about non-linearity in the context of model assumptions.
	+ Does this mean we can have other non-linear effects?
	+ Yes, and it looks a lot like an interaction.

+ The equation with a non-linear term for `\(X\)`:

`$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i} + \beta_2 z_{i} + \beta_3 xx_{i} + \epsilon_i$$`


`$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i} + \beta_2 z_{i} + \beta_3 x_{i}^2 + \epsilon_i$$`

---
#  How do we know to include non-linear? 

+ Theory
	+ Power for non-linear (higher order, interaction) effects is usually low (see final slides).
	+ This, and other features of data (e.g. skew), can lead to spurious interactions.
	+ So the best plan is not to go looking for them unless there is solid theory. But?

+ Sometimes data speaks up and let?s us know something may be misspecified in our models.
	+ E.g. evidence for non-linearity in our assumption checks.
	+ Inclusion of higher-order/interaction terms can help resolve issues with violated model assumptions (linearity &amp; heteroscedasticity).


---
#  Power and interactions 

+ Statistical power for identifying interactions is generally low.

--

+ This means that both Type I and Type II error rates are increased.
	+ We may fail to reject the null when we should.
	+ We may reject the null when we should not.

--

+ With low power there is also a tendency for effects to be over estimated.

--

+ What does all this mean?
	+ If you identify an interaction in an observational study with low N, be **very** cautious in your interpretation.
	+ What is low N? We will talk more about this in the last week.
