# ONLINE LEARNING
+ **Will we be online all year?**
  + This is being reviewed as the government updates guidelines and the COVID situation changes.
  + My best guess, yes.

# ONLINE LEARNING
+ **How will on-line teaching work?**

+ Lectures
  + Recorded, with exercises.

+ Labs
  + Self-directed learning with supported drop-ins
  + Lecturer office hours
  

---
# DROP-IN'S AND PEER SUPPORT
+ 4 drop-in's per week.

+ In principle, you can attend them all
  + But, we need to have a bit of a trust/honour system.
  + If you have attended already in the week, and the session gets very full, allow others to ask questions

+ Open course room
  + Come and study any time.
  + If it is always full, we may have capacity issues, but I dont think this will happen.
  + Arrange with others to study togther here.
  + Discussion forum thread to find study partners at times that work for you all.

# FINDING HELP
+ Drop-in's

# PREVIOUS MATERIALS
+ **Can we also have access to year 1 dapR1 slides and resources?**
  + Given the pace of the courses, access to this years dapR1 is not likely going to be useful.
  + We made a "summer camp" set of materials available over the summer. 
  + We will add these to the Welcome Week folder.

# Questions

# ASSESSMENT
+ **When do we have tests, how often?**
  + Every week.
  + Quizzes will appear at the top of each "Weekly Materials" folder.
  + Quizzes are on the **previous weeks** content
  + Weeks 1 and 2 are practice and do not count towards your assessment.
  + There are 18 assessed quizzes. 
  + Always released on a Monday at 9am, close Sunday at 5pm GMT.
  + You have 1 hr to complete each test. 
  +~10 MCQ questions each time (sometimes fewer)
  + Best 14/18 scores are averaged to be your quiz mark.
  + Worth 10% overall grade.

---
# ASSESSMENT
+ **What happens if we miss a test?**
  + You can miss 4, or performing worse than you would have liked, and it has no impact (14/18)
  + If you miss more, and have reasons of suitable magnitude you can submit special circumstances
  + Otherwise it lowers your grade.
  
---
# ASSESSMENT
+ **When are the report deadlines?**
  + On LEARN dashboard there is a button for assessment. 
  + We will put all information on reports here.
  + We will add the deadlines this week
  + And let you know as and when we add details of the assessments.
  + Approximately, these will be set in ~week 8 of each semester.
