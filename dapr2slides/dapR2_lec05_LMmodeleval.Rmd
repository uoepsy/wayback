  + Coefficient of determination ( $R^2$ )

  + F-test for the model


---
#  Quality of the overall model 
+ When we measure an outcome ( $y$ ) in some data, the scores will vary (we hope).
  + Variation in $y$ = total variation of interest.

--

+ The aim of our linear model is to build a model which describes $y$ as a function of $x$.
	+ That is we are trying to explain variation in $y$ using $x$.

--

+ But it won't explain it all.
  + What is left unexplained is called the residual variance.

--

+ So we can breakdown variation in our data based on sums of squares as;

$$SS_{Total} = SS_{Model} + SS_{Residual}$$

---
#  Coefficient of determination 
+ One way to consider how good our model is, would be to consider the proportion of total variance our model accounts for. 

$$R^2 = \frac{SS_{Model}}{SS_{Total}} = 1 - \frac{SS_{Residual}}{SS_{Total}}$$

+ $R^2$ = coefficient of determination

--

  + Quantifies the amount of variability in the outcome accounted for by the predictors.
  + More variance accounted for, the better.
  + Represents the extent to which the prediction of $y$ is improved when predictions are based on the linear relation between $x$ and $y$.

--

+ Let's see how it works.
  + To do so, we need to calculate the different sums of squares.


---
# Total Sum of Squares

.pull-left[
+ Sums of squares quantify difference sources of variation.

$$SS_{Total} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2$$

+ Squared distance of each data point from the mean of $y$.

+ Mean is our baseline. 

+ Without any other information, our best guess at the value of $y$ for any person is the mean.

#  Coefficient of determination 
+ Now we can finally come back to $R^2$.

$$R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{Residual}}{SS_{Total}}$$

+ Or

$$R^2 = \frac{SS_{Model}}{SS_{Total}}$$

+ So in our example:

$$R^2 = \frac{SS_{Model}}{SS_{Total}} = \frac{22.9}{44.1} = 0.519$$

+ ** $R^2$ = 0.519 means that 52% of the variation in test scores is accounted for by hours of revision.**

#  Our example 

```{r}
res <- lm(score ~ hours, data = test)
summary(res)
```

As at the end of last session, we can check this against the R-output:
Be sure to flag small amounts of rounding difference from working through "by hand" and so presenting to less decimal places.

# Time for a break

**Quiz time!**


---
class: center, middle
# Welcome Back!

**Where we left off... **

We had just calculated $R^2$

Now let's look at calculating significance tests for our model


---
#  Significance of the overall model 
+ The test of the individual predictors (IVs, or $x$'s) does not tell us if the overall model is significant or not.
	+ Neither does R-square
	+ But both are indicative

+ To test the significance of the model as a whole, we conduct an $F$-test.

---
#  F-ratio
+ $F$-ratio tests the null hypothesis that all the regression slopes in a model are all zero
  + We are currently talking about a model with only one $x$, thus one slope.
  + But the $F$-ratio test will generalise.

--

+ $F$-ratio is a ratio of the explained to unexplained variance:

$$F = \frac{MS_{Model}}{MS_{Residual}}$$

+ Where MS = mean squares

--

+ **What are mean squares?**
  + Mean squares are sums of squares calculations divided by the associated degrees of freedom.
  + The degrees of freedom are defined by the number of "independent" values associated with the different calculations.

---
# F-table

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ftest <- tibble(
  SS = c("Model", "Residual", "Total"),
  df = c("k", "n-k-1", " "),
  MS = c("SS model/df model", "SS residual/df residual", " "),
  Fratio = c("MS model/ MS residual", " ", " "),
  pvalue = c("F(df model,df residual)", "", "")
)

kable(ftest)%>%
  kable_styling(., full_width = F)
```

---
# Our example: F-table

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tibble(
  Component = c("Model", "Residual", "Total"),
  SS = c(22.9,21.2,44.1),
  df = c(1, 8, " "),
  MS = c(22.9, 2.65, " "),
  Fratio = c(8.641509, " ", " "),
  pvalue = c("F(1,8)", "", "")
) %>%
  kable(.)%>%
  kable_styling(., full_width = F)
```


---
# F-ratio
+ Bigger $F$-ratios indicate better models.
  + It means the model variance is big compared to the residual variance.

--

+ The null hypothesis for the model says that the best guess of any individuals $y$ value is the mean of $y$ plus error.
	+ Or, that the $x$ variables carry no information collectively about $y$.

--

+ $F$-ratio will be close to 1 when the null hypothesis is true
  + If there is equivalent residual to model variation, $F$=1
	+ If there is more model than residual $F$ > 1

--

+ $F$-ratio is then evaluated against an $F$-distribution with $df_{Model}$ and $df_{Residual}$ and a pre-defined $\alpha$

--

+ Testing the $F$-ratio evaluates statistical significance of the overall model

# Summary of today

+ We have looked at evaluating the overall model.

+ $R^2$, or coefficient of determination, tells us how much total variance is explained by our model

+ $F$-ratio or $F$-test provide a significance test of the overall model
