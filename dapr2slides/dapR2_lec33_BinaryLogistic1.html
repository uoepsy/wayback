#  Binary outcomes 

+ Thus far we have discussed:
	+ linear regression with a continuous DV
	+ linear regression with categorical (including binary) predictors

+ What if we have a binary outcome variable?
	+ E.g.,:
		+ Healthy vs diseased
		+ Died vs survived
		+ Hired vs not hired
		+ Correct vs incorrect

+ When we have binary outcome variable, linear regression is no longer appropriate
	+ Let's see what happens when we fit a linear regression model with a binary outcome variable?


---
#  Applying linear regression to binary outcomes 

+ We can code our outcome in terms of whether or not an event happened
	+ `\(Y=1\)` for a job offer (event occurred)
	+ `\(Y=0\)` for no job offer (event did not occur)
		
+ If we then fit a linear regression model, our model predicts the probability of the event occurring `\(P(Y=1)\)` or `\(P(y_i)\)`


---
#  Some example data 
+ Imagine we're interested in predicting hiring decisions. 

+ We collect data on n=242 job-seekers
	+ Age
	+ Effort put into job application

+ Our variables:
	+ DV: `work` (0 = did not get job; 1 = did get job)
	+ IV1: `age` (in years)
	+ IV2: `msrch` (effort into job application, 0=low effort, 1 = high effort)


---
#  Visualize Our Data 

.pull-left[

+ Here we can see:

1. We have slightly more people being hired than not (light blue bar in left-hand plot)

2. Those who were hired (blue) are younger than those who were not (red) (density plot, top right)

3. There is a greater number of people who work hard (proportion of blue in bottom right plot) among those who were hired (right hand bar of this plot)

# Proportion hired


```r
hire %&gt;%
  group_by(work) %&gt;%
  summarise(
    n = n()) %&gt;%
  mutate(
    Prop = round(n/sum(n),2)
  ) 
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 3
##   work      n  Prop
## * &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 0       117  0.48
## 2 1       125  0.52
```


---
#  Linear probability model 
+ So let's just use `lm()` to predict our outcome (Hire vs no hire)
  + **Note**: R will actually try and stop us doing this if `work` is a factor
  + So we have to pretend to R that it is numeric. 


```r
hire &lt;- hire %&gt;%
  mutate(
*   work = as.numeric(work)
  )
m1 &lt;- lm(work ~ age, data = hire)
```

#  Violated assumptions 

.pull-left[

+ The plots here were produced using the `check_model()` function in the `performance()` package.

+ These are not ideally formatted plots for reports, but it is a nice quick way to look at all assumption plots.

+ Can also be used for different diagnostics like `vif` etc.

#  Impossible probabilities

.pull-left[
+ And there is a further issue?

+ By definition, probabilities must be between 0 and 1.

+ But our model predicts some `\(P(Y=1)\)` values &gt;1 within the plausible range of age values

#  The problem with linear regression 

+ In general, when we apply linear regression to binary outcomes:
	+ The distribution of the residuals is bimodal (not normal)
	+ The variance of the residuals is not constant
	+ The relation between `\(x\)` and `\(y\)` is not linear
	+ Probabilities are not constrained to be between 0 and 1
	
+ The logistic regression model solves these issues with linear regression

# Welcome Back!

**Let's get some details on the logistic model**

---
#  The logistic regression model 
+ In logistic regression, we predict the probability that `\(Y=1\)`, `\(P(y_i)\)`, from our X's, using:

`$$P(y_i) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1)}}$$`

+ `\(e\)` = exponential
+ `\(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1\)` is a linear combination with:
	+ a constant `\(\beta_0\)` (intercept), and
	+ `\(\beta_1\)` capturing the effect of `\(x_1\)` on the outcome `\(y\)`


---
#  The logistic regression model 

&lt;img src="logistic_model.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
#  Probability, odds and log-odds
+ An alternative way to think about this is in terms of probability, odds and log-odds.

+ Our presentation above includes the exponential of the coefficients so that (a) predictions are bounded within 0 and 1, and (b) we can have a linear representation.

+ The alternative way to view it is to change what we are predicting...


---
#  Probability, odds and log-odds



.pull-left[

+ `\(Probability = P(Y_i)\)`

+ `\(odds = \frac{P(Y=1)}{1-P(Y=1)}\)`

+ `\(logodds = ln \left (\frac{P(Y=1)}{1-P(Y=1)} \right)\)`

]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="MC_logistic.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

---
#  Logistic models with different slopes 
+ Given that we can see our log-odds provide a linear relation, we can think about predicting these:

`$$ln \left (\frac{P(Y=1)}{1-P(Y=1)} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1$$`
+ and we can easily extend to models with multiple predictors:

`$$P(y_i) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 ... + \beta_kx_k)}}$$`

+ Or

`$$ln \left (\frac{P(Y=1)}{1-P(Y=1)} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 ... + \beta_kx_k$$`


---
#  Estimating logistic regression coefficients 
+ Linear regression models can be estimated using least squares estimation

+ Logistic regression models are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)

+ MLE  finds the logistic regression coefficients that *maximise the likelihood of the observed data having occurred*
	+ While least squares estimation minimises the SSE to find the coefficients for the line of best, MLE minimises the log-likelihood
	+ Larger log-likelihood values indicate poorer fitting models



---
#  Overall model evaluation 
+ To evaluate overall model fit in logistic regression we:
	+ Compare our model to a baseline model with no predictors (null model)
	+ Assess the improvement in fit
	+ *Note we have already seen this idea when discussing the `\(F\)`-test and incremental `\(F\)`-test*
	
+ The baseline model is where the predicted values for the DV are based on the most frequent value of the DV (0 or 1)
	+ Our best guess of the DV value in the absence of informative predictors.
	+ Analogous to using the mean DV value as the baseline in linear regression.

---
#  Overall model evaluation 
+ We compare our model with the baseline model using **deviance**:

`$$deviance = -2*loglikelihood$$`

+ Deviance often denoted **-2LL**

---
#  Overall model evaluation 
+ We calculate the -2LL differences between our model and the baseline model.

+ We assess the statistical significance of the -2LL difference to see if our model significantly improves on the baseline model
	+ We compare our -2LL difference to a `\(\chi^2\)` distribution with df = k
		+ k= number of predictors in model
		
+ Significant `\(p\)`-value indicates that our model improves on the baseline model.

+ Assessing the -2LL differences in this way is called a likelihood ratio test or chi-square difference test

**Logistic regression in r** 



---
#  The `glm()` function 
+ In R, we conduct logistic regression using the `glm()` function

+ `glm` stands for **g**eneralised **l**inear **m**odel
  + More on this next week
  
+ Very similar in structure to the `lm()` function


---
#  Run our model: a little more code 


```r
*m2 &lt;- glm(work ~ age + msrch, data = hire,
    family = "binomial")
```

+ `glm()`; R function for running generalised linear models.
	+ Provide a formula in the same style as lm()
	+ Provide the name of the dataset

---
#  Run our model: a little more code 


```r
m2 &lt;- glm(work ~ age + msrch, data = hire, 
*   family = "binomial")
```

+ The new bit.
	+ We need to start what family of probability distributions we want for our DV.
	+ This relates to the type of variable our DV is.
	+ We will take a little more about this next lecture.
	+ For now, for a binary variable, we want `family = binomial`

---
# Quick aside: Why binomial?
+ Binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution. (you do not need to remember the probability mass function below - don't worry.)

`$$f(k,n,p) = Pr(X = k) = \binom{n}{k}p^{k}q^{n-k}$$`

+ `\(k\)` = number of success
+ `\(n\)` = total trials, 
+ `\(p\)` = probability success
+ `\(q\)` = `\(1-p\)` or probability of failure
+ `\(\binom{n}{k}\)` = `\(n\)` choose `\(k\)`, or the number of ways to select `\(k\)` unordered items from a set of `\(n\)` items.

+ Practically, we can think of every instance of a `Hire` in out example as a success, and every `no hire` as a failure.

+ Logistic regression is estimated using maximum likelihood estimation

+ Implemented using `glm()` function in R
