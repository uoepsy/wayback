# The challenge

.pull-left[
+ Model selection refers to choosing between competing statistical models 

+ An important aspect of model selection is choosing which predictors out of all of those that you have collected should be included in your model

+ Challenge is to strike a balance and avoid:
  + Over-fitting 
  + Under-fitting

+ No hard and fast rules for model selection

+ Requires using your judgement

# Why not include everything?

.pull-left[

+ **Theoretical**: The principle of parsimony 
  + Occam’s razor
  + All else being equal, simpler models are better 

+ **Practical**: Impact on precision and power
  + Having large numbers of predictors increases standard errors and reduces the power to detect the effects of individual predictors

---
# Selection criteria

+ **Theoretical**: The theory you are testing implies the predictors to include.
  + e.g., you are testing the theory of planned behaviour, therefore, must include attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control

+ **Covariate control**: A certain predictor(s) is/are known to be a potential confound and must be included in the model to control for it
  + e.g., you are interested in the effects of personality on health but must control for the potential confounds of age. 

+ **Statistical**: The predictor(s) contributes in a statistically or practically significant sense to improving variance explained in the outcome.

---
# Statistical approaches
+ For a single predictor, to decide whether we want it in the model we could look at the magnitude and statistical significance of its slope.

+ When thinking about model selection, we think about sets of predictors

+ Sets of predictors could include:
  + A structural set which together encode the effects of a single construct (e.g. dummy variables)
  + A functional set which represents a block of conceptually related predictors (e.g. Big Five personality traits)		

+ For either a single predictor, or a set, we can statistically compare models with and without those variables.
  + Incremental F-test
  + AIC
  + BIC


---
# Example
+ Our example for today uses data from the Midlife In United States (MIDUS2) study.

+ Outcome: self-rated health

+ Covariates: Age, sex

+ Predictors: Big Five traits and Purpose in Life.

# Incremental F-test
+ Recall, the F-ratio for a single model tests the statistical significance of a linear model

+ The incremental F-test evaluates the statistical significance of the improvement in variance explained in an outcome with the addition of further predictor(s)

+ It is based on the difference in F-values between two models.
  + Note: The F-test as we have already seen it could also be viewed in this way.
  + As the difference between a model with predictors and an "empty model" (intercept only)

+ We call the model with the additional predictor(s) model 1 or full model

+ We call the model without model 0 or restricted model

---
# Incremental F-test

.pull-left[
`$$\Delta F_{(\Delta k, N- k_1 - 1)} = \frac{(N-k_1 - 1)\Delta R^2}{\Delta k(1-R_1^2)}$$`

$$
`\begin{align}
&amp; \text{Where:} \\
&amp; k_1 = \text{no. predictors from model 1} \\
&amp; \Delta R^2 = \text{difference in R2 between model 0 and 1} \\
&amp; \Delta k = \text{difference in no. predictors model 0 and 1} \\
&amp; R_1^2 = \text{R2 value from model 1} \\
\end{align}`
$$

.pull-right[
`$$F_{(df_R-df_F),df_F} = \frac{(SSR_R-SSR_F)/(df_R-df_F)}{SSR_F / df_F}$$`



$$
`\begin{align}
&amp; \text{Where:} \\
&amp; SSR_R = \text{residual sums of squares for the restricted model} \\
&amp; SSR_F = \text{residual sums of squares for the full model} \\
&amp; df_R = \text{residual degrees of freedom from the restricted model} \\

# Incremental F-test: calculation
`$$\Delta F_{(\Delta k, N- k_1 - 1)} = \frac{(N-k_1 - 1)\Delta R^2}{\Delta k(1-R_1^2)}$$`

+ `\(N\)` = 1761
+ `\(k_0\)` = 2
+ `\(k_1\)` = 7
+ `\(\Delta k\)` = 5
+ `\(R_{m0}^2\)` = 0.0046268
+ `\(R_{m1}^2\)` = 0.148435
+ `\(\Delta R^2\)` = 0.1438082


---
# Incremental F-test: calculation
`$$\Delta F_{(\Delta k, N- k_1 - 1)} = \frac{(N-k_1 - 1)\Delta R^2}{\Delta k(1-R_1^2)}$$`

+ Plug in our values

`$$\Delta F_{(5, 1753)} = \frac{(1761-7 - 1)0.1438}{5(1-0.1484)}$$`

+ Work them through:

`$$\Delta F_{(5, 1753)} = \frac{252.0814}{4.2595}$$`

+ And there we go (we have rounded the numbers above, so this will not match perfectly)

`$$\Delta F_{(5, 1753)} = 59.18098$$`

---
# Incremental F-test: Significance
+ Having calculated `\(\Delta F\)`, we then compare it against an F-distribution with `\(\Delta k\)` and `\((N-k_1 - 1)\)` degrees of freedom. 

+ This provides a p-value for the change in variance explained by model 1 versus model 0 for a given `\(\alpha\)`

+ In our example:


```r
pf(.95, 5, 1753)
```

```
## [1] 0.5525509

# Nested vs non-nested models
+ The F-ratio depends on the models being compared being nested

+ Nested means that the predictors in one model are a subset of the predictors in the other

+ We also require the models to be computed on the same data


---
# Nested vs non-nested models

.pull-left[
**Nested**


```r
m0 &lt;- lm(outcome ~ x1 + x2 , data = data)

m1 &lt;- lm(outcome ~ x1 + x2 + x3, data = data)
```

+ These models are nested.

+ `x1` and `x2` appear in both models
]


.pull-right[
**Non-nested**


```r
m0 &lt;- lm(outcome ~ x1 + x2 + x4, data = data)

m1 &lt;- lm(outcome ~ x1 + x2 + x3, data = data)
```

+ These models are non-nested

+ There are unique variables in both models
  + `x4` in `m0`
  + `x3` in `m1`

]

class: center, middle
# Time for a break

**Time to have a look at a few model specifications and decide if they are nested.**

---
class: center, middle
# Welcome Back!

**What happens when models are non-nested?**


---
# AIC
`$$AIC = n\,\text{ln}\left( \frac{SS_{residual}}{n} \right) + 2k$$`

$$
`\begin{align}
&amp; \text{Where:} \\
&amp; SS_{residual} = \text{sum of squares residuals} \\
&amp; n = \text{sample size} \\
&amp; k = \text{number of explanatory variables} \\
&amp; \text{ln} = \text{natural log function} 
\end{align}`
$$


+ Unlike the incremental F-test AIC does not require two models to be nested

+ Smaller (more negative) values of AIC indicate better fitting models.
  + So we compare values and choose the model with the smaller AIC


---
# AIC parsimony correction

`$$AIC = n\,\text{ln}\left( \frac{SS_{residual}}{n} \right) + 2k$$`


+ Main point to note is that the term `\(2k\)` applies a penalty for having more predictors

+ When you add more predictors, fit will improve ( `\(SSE\)` will get smaller)

+ The decrease is partially offset by the `\(+2k\)`

+ This makes AIC a parsimony-corrected statistic

+ Parsimony-corrected statistics help us avoid over-fitting

---
# In R


```r
AIC(m0, m1)
```

```
##    df      AIC
## m0  4 6749.246
## m1  9 6484.457
```

---
# BIC
`$$BIC = n\,\text{ln}\left( \frac{SS_{residual}}{n} \right) + k\,\text{ln}(n)$$`
$$
`\begin{align}
&amp; \text{Where:} \\
&amp; SS_{residual} = \text{sum of squares residuals} \\
&amp; n = \text{sample size} \\
&amp; k = \text{number of explanatory variables} \\
&amp; \text{ln} = \text{natural log function} 
\end{align}`
$$


+ Like AIC... 
  + BIC doesn’t require nested models
  + Smaller (more negative) BIC values mean better models
  + We can compare the BICs for two models and choose the one with the smaller BIC as the better model


---
# In R


```r
BIC(m0, m1)
```

```
##    df      BIC
## m0  4 6771.141
## m1  9 6533.719
```

---
# Parsimony corrections

`$$AIC = n\,\text{ln}\left( \frac{SS_{residual}}{n} \right) + 2k$$`

`$$BIC = n\,\text{ln}\left( \frac{SS_{residual}}{n} \right) + k\,\text{ln}(n)$$`

+ BIC has a ‘harsher’ parsimony penalty for typical sample sizes when applying linear models than AIC
  
+ When `\(\text{ln}(n) &gt; 2\)` BIC will have a more severe parsimony penalty (i.e. essentially all the time!)


---
# Considerations for use of AIC and BIC
+ The AIC and BIC for a model are not meaningful on their own 
  + They only make sense for model comparisons

+ For AIC, there are no cut-offs to suggest how big a difference in two models is needed to conclude that one is substantively better than the other

+ For BIC, a difference of 10 can be used as a rule of thumb to suggest that one model is substantively better than another


---
# Using statistical tools
+ AIC and BIC sometimes tell a different story.
  + Due to the parsimony corrections

+ This means it is more likely to lead you to select a ‘simpler’ model (i.e., a model with fewer predictors) than AIC

+ Requires you to think about whether you are more concerned about avoiding over-fitting or under-fitting

+ Similarly, both AIC and BIC can tell a different from the incremental F-test.

---
# Missing data
+ It is important to make sure the two models being compared with incremental F, AIC and BIC are fit to the same cases (participants).

+ Beware when you have missing data for your predictors.

# Welcome Back!

**So far we have assumed we have a theoretical model(s) and we are comparing them**

**What if we don't?**

---
# Automated approaches
+ Exploratory models

+ "Stepwise" methods
  + Forward selection
  + Backward selection

+ All possible subsets

---
# Forward

+ Start with the variable which has the highest association with the DV.

+ Next, add the variable which increases r-squared most of those which remain.

+ Continue until no variables improve model r-square.


---
# Backward

+ Start with all variables in the model.

+ Remove the predictor with the highest p-value.

+ Run the model again and repeat.

+ Stop when all p-values for predictors are less than the a priori set critical p-value. 

---
# Good idea?

&lt;img src="./fishing.png" width="50%" /&gt;


---
# All possible regressions
+ Start with a model with only the intercept (“empty model”, best guess with no predictors).

+ Then run all possible models with 1 variable.

+ Then run all possible models with 2 variables.

+ Then run all possible models with 3 variables.

+ And so on until you reach the maximum number of predictors.

+ Results in lots of models.
  + `\(2^k\)` where k=number of predictors.
  + E.g. 12 predictors = `\(2^{12}\)` = 4096 equations

---
# All possible subsets
+ An essentially identical procedure is all-possible-regressions.

+ Here select a subset of key variables

+ Note if you have designed your study well this will be all your variables.

+ Run all models with 1 predictor, 2 predictors etc.

+ Select and present the best model for each number of predictors.
  + Thus if we had 8 predictors, we would evaluate 8 possible models (+empty model).

---
# Good idea?

&lt;img src="./thinice.png" width="25%" /&gt;


---
# Broad considerations
+ Atheoretical.

+ Solely for predictive purposes.

+ A solution may be numerically better than others, but it may not be interpretable.

+ General issues with multiple comparisons.

+ Quality of the model is still dependent on the design and inclusion of good variable sets.

+ The selection of the “best” model may also be influenced by the criteria you use to define what is best.


---
# Summary of today

+ Introduced the general problem of model selection.

+ Discussed various statistical tools and their differences for deciding between models.

+ Discussed data driven exploratory model building tools (and there issues)
