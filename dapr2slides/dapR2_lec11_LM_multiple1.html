# Weeks Learning Objectives
1. Understand how to extend a simple regression to multiple predictors. 

2. Understand and interpret the coefficients in multiple linear regression models

3. Understand how to include and interpret models with categorical variables with 2+ levels. 

---
# Topics for today

+ Introducing additional predictors

+ Evaluation of the overall model

+ Evaluation of individual predictors

---
#  Multiple regression 
+ The aim of a linear model is to explain variance in an outcome

+ In simple linear models, we have a single predictor, but the model can accommodate (in principle) any number of predictors. 

+ However, when we include multiple predictors, those predictors are likely to correlate

+ Thus, a linear model with multiple predictors finds the optimal prediction of the outcome from several predictors, **taking into account their redundancy with one another**


---
#  Uses of multiple regression 
+ **For prediction:** multiple predictors may lead to improved prediction. 

+ **For theory testing:** often our theories suggest that multiple variables together contribute to variation in an outcome

+ **For covariate control:** we might want to assess the effect of a specific predictor, controlling for the influence of others.
	+ E.g., effects of personality on health after removing the effects of age and sex


---
#  Extending the regression model 

+ Our model for a single predictor:

`$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \epsilon_i$$` 

+ is extended to include additional `\(x\)`'s:

`$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 x_{2i} + \beta_3 x_{3i} + \epsilon_i$$`  

+ For each `\(x\)`, we have an additional `\(b\)`
  + `\(\beta_1\)` is the coefficient for the 1st predictor
  + `\(\beta_2\)` for the second etc.


---
#  Interpreting coefficients in multiple regression 

`$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 x_{2i} + \beta_j x_{ji} + \epsilon_i$$`

+ Given that we have additional variables, our interpretation of the regression coefficients changes a little

+ `\(\beta_0\)` = the predicted value for `\(y\)` **all** `\(x\)` are 0.
	
+ Each `\(\beta_j\)` is now a **partial regression coefficient**
	+ It captures the change in `\(y\)` for a one unit change in , `\(x\)` **when all other x's are held constant**

+ What does holding constant mean? 
  + Refers to finding the effect of the predictor when the values of the other predictors are fixed
		+ It may also be expressed as the effect of **controlling for**, or **partialling out**, or **residualizing for** the other `\(x\)`'s

+ With multiple predictors `lm` isolates the effects and estimates the unique contributions of predictors.

???
+ In simple linear models, we could visualise the model as a straight line in 2D space
	+ Least squares finds the coefficients that produces the *regression line* that minimises the vertical distances of the observed y-values from the line

+ In a regression with  2 predictors, this becomes a regression plane in 3D space
	+ The goal now becomes finding the set of coefficients that minimises the vertical distances between the *regression*  *plane* and the observed y-values

+ The logic extends to any number of predictors
	+ (but becomes very difficult to visualise!)

---
#  Example: lm with 2 predictors 

+ Imagine we were interested in examining predictors of school performance.  

+ we get a teacher rating of child's performance, a self-report measure of self control, and also measure teacher rated class interaction. 

+ We collect data on a sample of n=650 12 year old and fit a linear model.

+ We'll fit the model to `\(z\)`-scores for all variables. 
  + Remember `\(z\)`-scores have a mean of 0, and a SD of 1
  + So "1 unit" of a `\(z\)`-score is 1 SD

Overview lm with multiple predictors

Now we will look at model evaluation


---
#  `\(R^2\)` 
+ Like in simple regression, we use `\(R^2\)` for overall model evaluation.

+ The sums of squares used to calculate `\(R^2\)` are defined in the same way as for simple regression.


`$$SS_{total} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{Y})^2$$`


`$$SS_{Residual} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$$`


`$$SS_{Model} = SS_{total} - SS_{residual}$$`

???
+ The only difference is that is based on multiple IVs.

---
#  `\(R^2\)` 

+ `\(R^2\)` is then calculated in the same way as in simple regression:

`$$R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{residual}}{SS_{total}}$$`

+ or

`$$R^2 = \frac{SS_{model}}{SS_{total}}$$`

---
#  `\(R^2\)` interpretation 

+ `\(R^2\)` = the proportion of variation in the outcome accounted for by the model (all the predictors)

+ It's square root is now the multiple correlation coefficient between predictors and outcome

+ The multiple correlation coefficient summarizes the shared relationship between `\(Y\)` and a set of variables `\(x\)`'s
	+ It is the squared correlation between the observed `\(y\)` and predicted `\(y\)` values.

---
#  Adjusted `\(R^2\)` 
+ We can also compute an adjusted `\(R^2\)` when our lm has 2+ predictors.
  + `\(R^2\)` is an inflated estimate of the corresponding population value

+ Due to random sampling fluctuation, even when `\(R^2 = 0\)` in the population, it's value in the sample may `\(\neq 0\)` 

+ In **smaller samples** , the fluctuations from zero will be larger on average

+ With **more IVs** , there are more opportunities to add to the positive fluctuation


`$$\hat R^2 = 1 - (1 - R^2)\frac{N-1}{N-k-1}$$`

+ Adjusted `\(R^2\)` adjusts for both sample size ( `\(N\)` ) and number of predictors ( `\(k\)` )

#  In our academic performance example 

+ **Based on adjusted R-squared, self-control and class interaction together explain 23.3% of the variance in academic performance**

+ As the sample size is large and the number of predictors small, unadjusted ( 0.235 ) and adjusted R-squared ( 0.233 ) are similar.


---
#  `\(F\)`-ratio 
+ Like in simple regression, the `\(F\)`-ratio is used to test the null hypothesis that **all** model slopes are zero.

+ It is calculated in exactly the same way as in simple linear model:

`$$F = \frac{MS_{Model}}{MS_{Residual}} = \frac{\frac{SS_{model}}{df_{model}}}{\frac{SS_{residual}}{df_{residual}}}$$`

+ Where
	+ df model = `\(k\)`
	+ df residual = `\(N\)` - `\(k\)` - 1
		  + `\(N\)` = sample size
		  + `\(k\)` = number of predictors

**No specific task this time**

But use this as a chance to post some questions on the discussion board.


---
class: center, middle
# Welcome Back!

**Where we left off... **

We have evaluated the overall model...

...now time for the individual predictors


---
#  Evaluating individual predictors

+ Broadly follows the same procedure as in simple regression:
	+ Standard errors (SEs) for each regression slope are computed
	
	+ SE gives a measure of the sampling variability of a regression coefficient
	
	+ `\(t\)`-tests and confidence intervals evaluate the statistical significance of regression slopes

---
#  Standard errors 

.pull-left[

`$$SE(\hat \beta_j) = \sqrt{\frac{ SS_{Residual}/(n-k-1)}{\sum(x_i - \bar{x})^2}}$$`

]


.pull-right[

`$$SE(\hat \beta_j) = \sqrt{\frac{ SS_{Residual}/(n-k-1)}{\sum(x_{ij} - \bar{x_{ij}})^2(1-R_{xj}^2)}}$$`

+ `\(1-R_{xj}^2\)` is capturing the correlation between `\(x_j\)` and all other `\(x\)`'s

]

---
#  Standard errors

`$$SE(\hat \beta_j) = \sqrt{\frac{ SS_{Residual}/(n-k-1)}{\sum(x_{ij} - \bar{x_{ij}})^2(1-R_{xj}^2)}}$$`

+ Examining the above formula we can see that:
	+ `\(SE\)` is smaller when residual variance ( `\(SS_{residual}\)` ) is smaller
	+ `\(SE\)` is smaller when sample size ( `\(N\)` ) is larger
	+ `\(SE\)` is larger when the number of predictors ( `\(k\)` ) is larger
	+ `\(SE\)` is larger when a predictor is strongly correlated with other predictors ( `\(R_{xj}^2\)` )

???
+ Well return to this later when we discuss multi-collinearity issues

---
#  Significance of coefficients 

+ Once we have the standard error, all else is the same:

`$$t = \frac{\hat \beta_1}{SE(\hat \beta_1)}$$`

+ A `\(t\)`-test of the null hypothesis that `\(b_j = 0\)`

+ The `\(t\)`-value is compared to a `\(t\)`-distribution with N-k-1 degrees of freedom to assess statistical significance at a given `\(\alpha\)`.

---
#  Our academic performance example

## z_interaction -1.175418e-02 0.03444282 -3.412664e-01 7.330139e-01
```


**Self-control (t(647)=14.05, p&lt;.001) was a significant predictor of academic performance ( `\(\alpha = 0.05\)` ), and so we reject the null hypothesis of no effect. However, we failed to reject the null for class interaction (t(647)=-0.34, p&gt;.05).**


---
#  Confidence intervals 

+ Like in simple regression, we can also compute confidence intervals for slopes in multiple regression.

+ The 100(1-alpha) confidence interval for the slope is:

`$$\hat \beta_1 \pm t^* \times SE(\hat \beta_1)$$`


```r
tibble(
  lower = res$coefficients[2,1] - round(qt(0.975, 647), 3) *  res$coefficients[2,2],
  upper = res$coefficients[2,1] + round(qt(0.975, 647), 3) *  res$coefficients[2,2]
)
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 x 2
##   lower upper
##   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 0.416 0.551
```


---
#  Confidence intervals 

+ Or the much easier version...


```r
confint(perf)
```

```
##                     2.5 %     97.5 %
## (Intercept)   -0.06747398 0.06747398
## z_SC           0.41621897 0.55148537
## z_interaction -0.07938738 0.05587903
```



---
#  Standardising coefficients 
+ Lastly, standardization follows the same steps as we have already seen.
  + Variables can be `\(z\)`-scored prior to analysis (our example)
  + Or can be standardized after model estimation. 

+ However, unlike in simple lm, the standardised regression coefficients are not equal to the Pearson correlation with multiple predictors between that IV and Y.
	+ They equal the **partial** correlation coefficient 
	+ the correlation between an predictor and outcome holding all the other predictors constant

---
# Summary of today

+ Considered the evaluation and interpretation of individual coefficients in lm with multiple predictors.

+ Looked at model evaluation for an lm with multiple predictors.

+ Seen that broadly, nothing much has changed.

+ Apart from the fact that we now must take account of the presence of other predictors and the correlations between them.
