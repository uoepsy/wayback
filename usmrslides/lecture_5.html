- the playmo crew have been out joyriding and were caught in a police speed trap

# Covariance

### Covariance
.br3.white.bg-gray.pa1[
$$ \textrm{cov}(x,y) = \frac{\sum{(x-\bar{x})\color{red}{(y-\bar{y})}}}{n} $$
]
???
- note that for any (x,y), `\(x-\bar{x}\)` might be positive and `\(y-\bar{y}\)` might be positive, so the covariance could be a negative number

- these are exactly the same 'values' so they should each be as correlated as the other

- so we need to divide covariance by something to represent the overall "scale" of the units

# Interpreting Correlation

- correlation does not imply causation

- correlation simply suggests that two variables are related

  + there may be mediating variables

- interpretation of that relationship is key

- never rely on statistics such as `\(r\)` without

  + looking at your data

  + thinking about the real world

# What is NHST all about?

## **N**ull **H**ypothesis **S**tatistical **T**esting

- two premises

  1. much of the variation in the universe is due to _chance_

  1. we can't _prove_ a hypothesis that something else is the cause

---
# Chance

.pull-left[
- when we say _chance_, what we really mean is "stuff we didn't measure"

- we believe that "pure" chance conforms approximately to predictable patterns (like the normal and `\(t\)` distributions)

  - if our data isn't in a predicted pattern, perhaps we haven't captured all of the non-chance elements

# Chance and Proof

.br3.pa2.bg-gray.white[if the likelihood that the pattern of data we've observed would be found _by chance_ is low enough, propose an alternative explanation
]

- work from summaries of the data (e.g., `\(\bar{x}\)`, `\(\sigma\)`)

- use these to approximate chance (e.g., `\(t\)` distribution)

--

  + catch: we can't estimate the probability of an exact value (this is an example of the measurement problem)
  
  + estimate the probability of finding the measured difference _or more_

---
# Alpha and Beta

- we need an agreed "standard" for proposing an alternative explanation

  + typically in psychology, we set `\(\alpha\)` to 0.05

  + "if the probability of finding this difference or more under chance is `\(\alpha\)` (e.g., 5%) or less, propose an alternative"
  
- we also need to understand the quality of evidence we're providing

  + can be measured using `\(\beta\)` (psychologists typically aim for 0.80)

  + "given that an effect truly exists in a population, what is the probability of finding `\(p&lt;\alpha\)` in a sample (of size `\(n\)` etc.)?"

# The Rest is Just Nuts and Bolts

- suitable estimated distribution (normal, `\(t\)`, `\(\chi^2\)`, etc.)

- suitable summary statistic ( `\(z\)`, `\(t\)`, `\(\chi^2\)`, `\(r\)`, etc.)

- use statistic and distribution to calculate `\(p\)` and compare to `\(\alpha\)`

- `\(t\)` (or `\(z\)`) statistics are really ubiquitous

- formally, mean difference divided by standard error

- conceptually:

  + what is the difference?
